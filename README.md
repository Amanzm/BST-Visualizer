# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C++. It provides functionalities to insert, print in postorder, and remove nodes from the BST. The program also includes a simple command-line interface for interacting with the BST.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `BST.h`: Header file containing the Binary Search Tree class definition.
- `BST.cpp`: Source file containing the implementation of BST member functions.
- `main.cpp`: Source file containing the main function and command-line interface for the BST operations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` for Linux/Mac, MinGW for Windows)
- Visual Studio Code (or any text editor/IDE of your choice)
